Step to install airflow on windows without Docker

Step 1: Control Panel | Programs and Features | Turn Windows features on or off
Enable : Windows Subsystem for Linux

Step 2: Install Ubuntu from windows store and restart system

Step 3: Install and update PIP
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-add-repository universe
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pip

Step 4: Install airflow 
python3 -m pip install apache-airflow

Step 5: Initialize DB('airflow initdb' is not working . so run the below command)
airflow db init

Step 6: Start airflow server.Run the below command. Here, airflow will start running at port 8080. You can change based on your choice as well.
airflow webserver -p 8080

Step 7: URL is ready at:(you can check typing this url on any web browser)
http://localhost:8080/

Step 8: Check the DAG folder:
From "\\wsl$\Ubuntu-20.04\home\mamunds\airflow(for my case) or
General: home\username\airflow " find out the "airflow.cfg" file. And then open it using any editor.
  To open you can use nano editor
     i)run nano airflow.cfg 
     ii) ctl+s <--> to save on nano editor
     iii)ctl+x <---> to exit from the nao editor
     
Check the dag folder paths.Make a dag folder exactly keeping same path like this.
For me when I open I see the location like this:
"dags_folder = /home/mamunds/airflow/dags" . this my dag folder path.
So I have created a folder name as "dags" inside the "airflow" folder simple.
Then if create any new dag file, I have put that file  inside the "dags" folder.

Then Step 9: After each putting dag files inside the dags folder , we have to initilize the db again always. So, 
run airflow initdb

N.B: DAG--> Direct acyclic graph


###### Note####
1.Always after adding a new dag. We have to initialize the  'airflow db init'--> initialize db  again as it's not refressed automatically.
 N.B: Bydeafult airflow se the sqlite database. Thats why this is not refressed automatically. If we use postgre as our database  then
 it can refress automatically. 
2.Update pip 
3. Write the bellow command for creating username and password:(if its asking for the password). Paste the below line in the linux command line.
you can put your own username and password.That would be nice.


    airflow users create --role Admin --username admin --email admin --firstname admin --lastname admin --password admin

4.If you open the ubuntu operating system you will see the a folder name as 'home'.  :). First time it was hard for me to find out this folder.
Note: just to remember for the future use.

5. To open the ubuntu folder directory:
     step i: windows+run
     step ii: paste \\wsl$
     step iii: press the enter button
     Then you will see the ubuntu directory(cool)

6. Just for simplicity: I have created the user on airflow using the above command(3:).So,
    username: admin
    password: admin
    similarly all are like above command. :)

7. My current ubuntu:
   username:mamunds
   pass:2****9

8. My microsoft store credentianls:
   email: allmamun556@gmail.com
   pass: 2****9_M
